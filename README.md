# AudioStitch
This repo is a Swift Playground where I have some quick code I use to combine audio files that are splitup


I have a [radio show](http://facebook.com/edmsoundsystem) where the audio recording done by the station is split up into 30 minute segments. Since my show is 3 hours, I combine these segments with this script. Trimming happens last. Downloading the files happens with a shortcut I made for my phone.
